# AoC
My Advent of Code Solutions

My convention is that every day is a separate directory, and that in each directory is a file named `test.txt` that contains the example problem from that day's description, and another file named `real.txt` that contains the actual input for that day. I put all .txt files in my `.gitignore` to respect AoC's request not to share them.
